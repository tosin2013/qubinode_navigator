- **KVM Configuration**: Configures the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) for running virtual machines.
- **Ansible Navigator**: Sets up Ansible Navigator for managing and automating infrastructure tasks.
- **HashiCorp Vault Integration**: Provides options for integrating with HashiCorp Vault for secure secret management.
- **SSH Configuration**: Configures SSH for secure remote access to the hypervisor.
- **Firewall Configuration**: Sets up the firewall to ensure secure communication.
- **Inventory Generation**: Generates an Ansible inventory file for managing the hypervisor and its associated resources.
- **Bash Aliases**: Configures custom bash aliases for easier command-line operations.
- **Route53 Configuration**: Optionally configures AWS Route53 for DNS management.
- **Cockpit SSL**: Configures SSL for the Cockpit web interface.
- **OneDev/GitLab/GitHub Integration**: Provides options for integrating with OneDev, GitLab, or GitHub for CI/CD pipelines.

## RHEL 9.5 Considerations
While the script is designed for RHEL 9, it is also compatible with RHEL 9.5. The following considerations should be taken into account when using the script on RHEL 9.5:

- **Package Compatibility**: Ensure that all required packages are available in the RHEL 9.5 repositories.
- **Security Updates**: RHEL 9.5 may include additional security patches and updates, which should be applied to the system before running the script.
- **Kernel Updates**: RHEL 9.5 may include updated kernel versions, which could affect the performance and stability of the hypervisor.
