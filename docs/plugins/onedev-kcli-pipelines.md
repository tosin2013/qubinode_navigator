## layout: default title:  "Legacy: OneDev Git Server with CI/CD" parent: Plugins nav_order: 3

[https://onedev.io/](https://onedev.io/) is a Git server with full support for pull requests, code reviews, and continuous integration. It also provides a Kanban board, a wiki, and a package registry. It is a self-hosted alternative to GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

> **Status:** Legacy integration
>
> These pipelines were originally used for CI/CD and VM orchestration via OneDev. New deployments should prefer the **Apache Airflow** integration and DAG workflows.
>
> - Airflow overview: [AIRFLOW-INTEGRATION.md](../AIRFLOW-INTEGRATION.md)
> - DAG workflows: [airflow-dag-deployment-workflows.md](../airflow-dag-deployment-workflows.md)
