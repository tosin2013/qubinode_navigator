# FreeIPA Workshop Deployer - The "Identity Management Specialist"
# =============================================================================
#
# üéØ PURPOSE FOR LLMs:
# This script deploys and configures FreeIPA identity management server with DNS
# services using the freeipa-workshop-deployer project. It provides centralized
# authentication, authorization, and DNS services for enterprise environments.
#
# üß† ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW FOR AI ASSISTANTS:
# This script implements FreeIPA deployment:
# 1. [PHASE 1]: Repository Management - Clones or updates freeipa-workshop-deployer
# 2. [PHASE 2]: Configuration Generation - Creates environment-specific configuration
# 3. [PHASE 3]: Variable Substitution - Updates configuration with domain and DNS settings
# 4. [PHASE 4]: Platform Configuration - Configures for kcli virtualization platform
# 5. [PHASE 5]: Service Deployment - Deploys FreeIPA server with DNS integration
# 6. [PHASE 6]: DNS Management - Configures dynamic DNS for workshop services
#
# üîß HOW IT CONNECTS TO QUBINODE NAVIGATOR:
# - [Identity Management]: Provides centralized authentication for infrastructure
# - [DNS Services]: Offers DNS resolution for workshop and lab environments
# - [Workshop Integration]: Supports educational and training deployments
# - [Virtualization Integration]: Works with kcli and KVM virtualization
# - [Domain Management]: Manages domain names and DNS records
#
# üìä KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR LLMs TO UNDERSTAND:
# - [Workshop-Focused]: Designed for educational and training environments
# - [DNS Integration]: Provides both identity management and DNS services
# - [Platform-Agnostic]: Supports multiple infrastructure providers (kcli, AWS)
# - [Dynamic Configuration]: Adapts to different domain and network configurations
# - [Cleanup-Capable]: Includes destruction and cleanup capabilities
#
# üí° WHEN TO MODIFY THIS SCRIPT (for future LLMs):
# - [FreeIPA Updates]: Update for new FreeIPA versions or features
# - [Platform Support]: Add support for new virtualization platforms
# - [DNS Enhancements]: Add support for new DNS providers or configurations
# - [Workshop Features]: Add new workshop services or integrations
# - [Security Updates]: Implement new security configurations or hardening
#
# üö® IMPORTANT FOR LLMs: This script deploys identity management infrastructure
# that affects authentication and DNS for the entire environment. It requires
# network configuration and may impact existing DNS settings.

function deploy_freeipa(){
# üéØ FOR LLMs: This function deploys FreeIPA identity management server with
# DNS services, configured for workshop and educational environments.
# üîÑ WORKFLOW:
# 1. Sets up environment variables and dependencies
# 2. Clones or updates freeipa-workshop-deployer repository
# 3. Configures deployment variables for current environment
# 4. Adapts configuration for kcli virtualization platform
# 5. Executes total deployment process
# üìä INPUTS/OUTPUTS:
# - INPUT: Environment variables and system configuration
# - OUTPUT: Deployed FreeIPA server with DNS services
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  SIDE EFFECTS: Creates virtual machines, modifies DNS configuration, requires network access

# FreeIPA Destruction Manager - The "Infrastructure Cleanup Specialist"
function destroy_freeipa(){
# üéØ FOR LLMs: This function safely destroys FreeIPA infrastructure and cleans up
# DNS records to return the environment to its original state.
# üîÑ WORKFLOW:
# 1. Destroys FreeIPA virtual machines using kcli
# 2. Retrieves IP address information for DNS cleanup
# 3. Removes dynamic DNS records for workshop services
# 4. Returns to home directory for cleanup completion
