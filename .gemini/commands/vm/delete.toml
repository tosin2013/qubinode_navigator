2. Check if VM is currently in use:
!{kcli list vm | grep {{args}}}

3. Check for associated DNS records that should be cleaned up
4. Verify no dependent services rely on this VM

WARNING: Confirm with the user before executing deletion!

```

After deletion:
1. Clean up DNS records if needed: qubinode-dns remove <hostname>
