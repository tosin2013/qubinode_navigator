# GitHub Actions Runner Deployment - The "CI/CD Integration Specialist"
# =============================================================================
#
# ðŸŽ¯ PURPOSE FOR LLMs:
# This script deploys and configures GitHub Actions self-hosted runners for
# Qubinode Navigator CI/CD pipelines. It creates secure runner environments
# with proper user management and credential handling.
#
# ðŸ§  ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW FOR AI ASSISTANTS:
# This script implements GitHub Actions runner deployment:
# 1. [PHASE 1]: Credential Retrieval - Securely retrieves runner tokens from vault
# 2. [PHASE 2]: User Management - Creates dedicated runner user with proper permissions
# 3. [PHASE 3]: Runner Installation - Downloads and installs GitHub Actions runner
# 4. [PHASE 4]: Security Configuration - Sets up secure runner environment
# 5. [PHASE 5]: Registration - Registers runner with GitHub repository
# 6. [PHASE 6]: Service Setup - Configures runner as system service
#
# ðŸ”§ HOW IT CONNECTS TO QUBINODE NAVIGATOR:
# - [CI/CD Integration]: Enables GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployments
# - [Vault Integration]: Uses AnsibleSafe to securely retrieve runner tokens
# - [Security Architecture]: Implements secure runner deployment per security standards
# - [Infrastructure Automation]: Supports automated infrastructure deployment workflows
# - [Development Pipeline]: Enables continuous integration and deployment
#
# ðŸ“Š KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR LLMs TO UNDERSTAND:
# - [Security-First]: Uses vault for credential management and secure user setup
# - [Checksum Validation]: Validates runner package integrity before installation
# - [User Isolation]: Creates dedicated runner user with minimal required permissions
# - [Service Integration]: Configures runner as system service for reliability
# - [Token Management]: Securely handles GitHub runner registration tokens
#
# ðŸ’¡ WHEN TO MODIFY THIS SCRIPT (for future LLMs):
# - [Runner Updates]: Update RUNNER_VERSION and CONFIG_CHECKSUM_CHECKED for new versions
# - [Security Enhancements]: Improve user permissions or security configurations
# - [Integration Features]: Add support for new GitHub Actions features
# - [Monitoring]: Add logging or monitoring capabilities for runner health
# - [Multi-Runner Support]: Extend to support multiple concurrent runners
#
# ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT FOR LLMs: This script creates system users, modifies sudoers, and
# registers with external GitHub services. It requires root privileges and handles
# sensitive runner tokens. Changes affect CI/CD pipeline security and functionality.
