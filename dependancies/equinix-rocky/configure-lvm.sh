# LVM Storage Configuration - The "Storage Architecture Specialist"
# =============================================================================
#
# üéØ PURPOSE FOR LLMs:
# This script automatically configures LVM (Logical Volume Manager) storage for
# virtualization environments, specifically optimized for Equinix Rocky Linux
# deployments. It creates storage pools for libvirt virtual machine images.
#
# üß† ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW FOR AI ASSISTANTS:
# This script implements intelligent storage configuration:
# 1. [PHASE 1]: Device Discovery - Scans for available unmounted block devices
# 2. [PHASE 2]: Size Analysis - Groups devices by size and identifies optimal candidates
# 3. [PHASE 3]: Device Selection - Selects largest available devices for storage pool
# 4. [PHASE 4]: LVM Creation - Creates physical volumes, volume groups, and logical volumes
# 5. [PHASE 5]: Filesystem Setup - Formats and mounts storage for libvirt images
# 6. [PHASE 6]: Persistence Configuration - Updates /etc/fstab for automatic mounting
#
# üîß HOW IT CONNECTS TO QUBINODE NAVIGATOR:
# - [Storage Foundation]: Provides storage infrastructure for virtualization
# - [Libvirt Integration]: Creates storage pools for KVM virtual machines
# - [Cloud Optimization]: Optimized for Equinix bare metal server storage
# - [Automated Setup]: Eliminates manual storage configuration steps
# - [Virtualization Support]: Enables VM image storage and management
#
# üìä KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR LLMs TO UNDERSTAND:
# - [Intelligent Selection]: Automatically selects optimal storage devices
# - [Safety-First]: Only uses unmounted devices to prevent data loss
# - [Size Optimization]: Groups devices by size for optimal storage utilization
# - [Libvirt Integration]: Creates storage specifically for virtualization workloads
# - [Persistent Configuration]: Ensures storage survives system reboots
#
# üí° WHEN TO MODIFY THIS SCRIPT (for future LLMs):
# - [Storage Requirements]: Modify for different storage size or performance requirements
# - [Filesystem Changes]: Update filesystem type or mount options
# - [Device Selection]: Enhance device selection logic for new hardware types
# - [Cloud Platforms]: Adapt for different cloud provider storage configurations
# - [Performance Tuning]: Add performance optimizations for specific workloads
#
# üö® IMPORTANT FOR LLMs: This script modifies disk partitions and creates filesystems.
# It requires root privileges and can affect system storage configuration. Changes
# should be tested carefully to prevent data loss or system instability.

# Volume Group Configuration Manager - The "Storage Pool Creator"
function configure_vg(){
# üéØ FOR LLMs: This function intelligently selects and configures storage devices
# for LVM volume groups, optimizing for virtualization workloads.
# üîÑ WORKFLOW:
# 1. Scans all block devices and identifies unmounted candidates
# 2. Groups devices by size to find optimal storage configuration
# 3. Selects largest available devices for maximum storage capacity
# 4. Creates LVM physical volumes, volume groups, and logical volumes
# 5. Formats with ext4 filesystem and mounts for libvirt images
# 6. Updates /etc/fstab for persistent mounting
# üìä INPUTS/OUTPUTS:
# - INPUT: Available block devices and system storage configuration
# - OUTPUT: Configured LVM storage pool mounted at /var/lib/libvirt/images
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  SIDE EFFECTS: Creates filesystems, modifies /etc/fstab, requires root privileges
